# npm resolution error report

While resolving: webpack-basic@1.0.0
Found: webpack@4.46.0
node_modules/webpack
  dev webpack@"^4.28.4" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer webpack@">=5" from babel-loader@9.1.3
node_modules/babel-loader
  dev babel-loader@"^9.1.3" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
