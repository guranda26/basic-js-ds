# npm resolution error report

While resolving: webpack-task@1.0.0
Found: webpack@5.88.2
node_modules/webpack
  dev webpack@"^5.88.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer webpack@"^4.0.0" from uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@2.2.0
node_modules/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin
  uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
