# npm resolution error report

While resolving: webpack-basic@1.0.0
Found: webpack@4.46.0
node_modules/webpack
  dev webpack@"^4.28.4" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer webpack@"^5.0.0" from style-loader@3.3.3
node_modules/style-loader
  style-loader@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
